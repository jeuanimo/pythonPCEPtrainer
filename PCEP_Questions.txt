Question Text:
Take a look at the snippet and choose one of the following statements which is true:

A. vals is longer than nums

Answer Options:
  B. nums and vals are of the same length
  C. nums is longer than vals

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:  In Python, lists are mutable objects. The assignment vals = nums does not create a new list; it simply creates a reference to the same list object. Therefore, both nums and vals point to the same underlying list. When vals.append(1) is executed, it modifies the shared list. As a result, both nums a

  C. [3, 5, 20, 5, 25, 1, 3]
  D. [1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 20, 25]

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:  The list nums is initialized as: nums = [3, 4, 5, 20, 5, 25, 1, 3] The method pop(1) is called. The pop() method removes the element at the specified index and returns it. Here, 1 is the index, so the element at index 1 (which is 4) is removed. After nums.pop(1), the list becomes: nums = [3, 5, 20,

  D. 1

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:  my_list = [3, 1, -2] print(my_list[my_list[-1]]) my_list[-1] retrieves the last element of the list, which is -2. Then, my_list[my_list[-1]] becomes my_list[-2], which is the second-to-last element of the list. my_list[-2] is 1 (the second-to-last element in the list [3, 1, -2]). Therefore, the out

  D. [1,2]

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:  In the given code: data = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} print(data['a', 'b']) data is a dictionary with keys 'a', 'b', and 'c'. When trying to access dictionary values, the key provided must be a single hashable object. In this case, ['a', 'b'] is a tuple (('a', 'b')), not a valid key in the dictionary.

Question Text:
The fact that tuples belong to sequence types means:

Answer Options:
  A. they can be modified using the del instruction
  B. they can be extended using the .append() method
  C. they are actually lists
  D. they can be indexed and sliced like lists

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:  Tuples are immutable sequence types in Python, meaning they cannot be modified (no item assignment or deletion) and do not have methods like .append() for extension. However, like other sequence types such as strings and lists, tuples support indexing and slicing to access their elements.

Which function does in-place reversal of objects in a list?

Answer Options:
  A. list.sort([func])
  B. list.pop(obj=list[-1])
  C. list.remove(obj)
  D. list.reverse()

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:  The list.reverse() method reverses the elements of the list in place, meaning it modifies the original list directly without creating a new list. This is the function that performs an in-place reversal of objects in a list.

What is the expected output of the following code?

Answer Options:
  A. ['1', '2', '3', '4']
  B. (1, 2, 3, 4)
  C. ('1', '2', '3', '4')
  D. The code is erroneous.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:  data1 = '1', '2': This is a tuple assignment. In Python, writing values separated by commas without parentheses creates a tuple. So, data1 becomes ('1', '2'). data2 = ('3', '4'): This explicitly creates a tuple with parentheses. So, data2 becomes ('3', '4'). data1 + data2: The + operator concatenat

How would you remove all the items from the d dictionary?
Expected output:
Code:

Correct Answer: D

Explanation:  d.clear() removes all items from the dictionary without deleting the dictionary itself. Other options: d.del() and d.remove() are invalid as these methods do not exist for dictionaries. del d deletes the dictionary entirely, resulting in d no longer being defined.

Answer Options:
  A. one
  B. three
  C. two

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:  The list my_list is created using a list comprehension. The expression [0 for i in range(1, 3)] generates a list containing the value 0 for each number in the range from 1 to 2 (inclusive of 1 and exclusive of 3). So, the range range(1, 3) produces two numbers: 1 and 2. Therefore, the list my_list

Answer Options:
  A. 17
  B. 17.5
  C. 8.5

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:  In Python, when using the insert() method with lists, the index -1 behaves differently from how negative indexing works for accessing elements. Negative index: With insert(-1, value), Python interprets -1 as "insert before the element at index -1". Since -1 refers to the last element for access, in
